## Project Description
This project takes a large dataset and reduces it to a tidier dataset, describing the averages of sensors collected per user per action.

##Study design and data processing
The initial data is filtered to include only averages and standard deviations, which are then averaged per user per action.  This reduces the dataset from 10299x563 to 180x81.

###Collection of the raw data
Data was collected by Anguita et al. [1] at Universit√† degli Studi di Genova, whose original notes are as follows:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

###Guide to create the tidy data file
1. Download/clone the github project.
2. Download the dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and expand the data directly into the source directory.
3. source("run_analysis.R")
4. The new tidy dataset will be written out as "awhill_summary.txt", and the filtered (but unaveraged) data will be available as merged_set in the R environment.

###Cleaning of the data
See README.md, included in this directory.
